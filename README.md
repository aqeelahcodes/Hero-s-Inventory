# Hero-s-Inventory
A mini game I created while attending Butler Community College for Software Development

## Languages used: 
C++

## About this project
Maintains the inventory of a Heroâ€™s in a game represented by an array which is a sequence of string objects one for each items in the Hero's possession. The Hero trades and finds new items

## Steps: 
Step 1: Inform the preprocessor to include the content of another file by using #include and include the file <iostream> from the standard library to display output    
Step 2: Include <string> from the standard library to access a string through a variable    
Step 3: Make std:: local so you don't have to prefix cout and endl    
Step 4: Create a main function that will return an integer value     
Step 5: Define a constant for the MAX number of elements in the inventory array so the compiler can reserve memory space    
Step 6: Index the string array 
Step 7: Display hero's inventory    
Step 8: Trade one inventory item for another 
Step 9: Access the size of the array
Step 10: Add a 4th item to the inventory array
